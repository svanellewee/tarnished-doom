# Tarnished Doom
Doom that starts as [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom) but hopefully will end up being all rust based.. Currently using C+Rust interop.

## Why, oh why?
Chocolate Doom is a wonderful project, C is a lovely language and all the best stuff is written in C. However, Rust is something I'd love to learn and replacing code of a rock-solid established project like Chocolate Doom, I feel, is a good start in learning something like Rust.

**So TL;DR Chocolate Doom is lovely. C is great. I want to learn Rust.**


## how to build
```sh
cargo build
```

Then you can run it like so:

```sh
./target/debug/tarnished-doom -iwad full-path-to-your-wad-file
```

Happy hacking!
