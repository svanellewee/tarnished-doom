# Tarnished Doom

Doom that starts as chocolate doom but hopefully will end up being all rust based.. Currently C+Rust interop.


## how to build
```sh
cd src/
./main_build.sh
cd ..
cargo build -vvv
```

Then you can run it like so:

```sh
./target/debug/tarnished-doom -iwad full-path-to-your-wad-file
```

Happy hacking!
